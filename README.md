# Condensed Matter Theory Research
Undergraduate research in condensed matter theory. The focus was on topological entanglement entropy in Kitaev honeycomb models and Ising models.
# File 1: Kitaev.py
This file constructs the Kitaev honeycomb model for a desired lattice size. The Hamiltonian is then constructed and used to find the topological entanglement entropy and the partial Von Neumann entropies.
