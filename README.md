# Condensed Matter Theory Research
Undergraduate research in condensed matter theory. The focus was on topological entanglement entropy in Kitaev honeycomb models and Ising models.
# File 1: Kitaev.py
This Python file constructs the Kitaev honeycomb model for a desired lattice size. The Hamiltonian is then constructed and used to find the topological entanglement entropy and the partial Von Neumann entropies.
# File 2: Kitaev.nb
This Mathematica notebook constructs the Kitaev honeycomb model for a desired lattic size. The Hamiltonian is then constructed and diagonalizaed. The partition function, internal energy, specific heat, and entropy are all constructed and some are plotted for different coupling values. The magnetization is then constructed and plotted for several values of the coupling as well as the magnetic susceptibility.
# File 3: Ising Model.nb
This Mathematica notebook constructs the Ising model for a desired chain length. The Hamiltonian is then constructed and diagonalizaed. The partition function, internal energy, specific heat, and entropy are all constructed and some are plotted for different coupling values. The magnetization is then constructed and plotted for several values of the coupling as well as the magnetic susceptibility.
